# Description

This one day course will get you up-to-speed with using R and RStudio for daily working with spatial data.
You will learn about R's powerful geospatial data processing, analysis and visualisation capabilities.
It is practical and hands-on: you'll *learn by doing*.
It assumes you already use R and want to extend your knowledge for spatial data applications.
It will cover the recently developed **sf** package, which is compatible with the **tidyverse**, representing the cutting-edge of spatial data applications.
It will provide a solid foundation (including spatial aggregation, joining, CRSs, visualisation) on which advanced analysis analysis workflows can be built.

# Learning outcomes

By the end of the course participants will:

 - Understand R's spatial ecosystem and which packages are 'future proof'
 - Know how to optimise RStudio for productive working with spatial data (you should already be proficient with RStudio)
 - Be able to read and write a variety of spatial data formats
 - Be proficient at common spatial operations including subsetting, cropping, aggregation and transformation
 - Be a confident map maker using the powerful **tmap** package
 - Know where to look for learning more advanced methods
 
## Prerequisites

In preparation for the course you should:

- Ensure that you have the latest versions of R and RStudio installed on your laptop: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- Brush up on your R skills if you're not an R user, e.g. with:
    - This excellent tutorial that you can work through to get used to the interface: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r
    - A more detailed account by Gillespie and Lovelace (2017): https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#rstudio
- Take a look at how GitHub works - we'll be using it for sharing course materials and sharing links and examples during the course, e.g. by reading this page (and following the tutorial if really keen): https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/


## Course materials

The course will be based on the first 5 chapters of the forethcoming book *Geocomputation with R* plus some additional materials:

- An introduction to geographic data in R
- Spatial data operations
- Geographic data I/O
- Introduction to visualising spatial data with R
- Point pattern analysis and rasterization
